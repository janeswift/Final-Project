For my final project I created an app called the wagePage app.

This app is geared towards people working in the service industry especially for people who work a service job that includes tips, to be able to calculate and keep track of what you're making on a weekly basis. The use of this app can be for using for budgeting purposes or just to generally know what you're making week to week for those who have direct deposit and don't get a check with a slip showing these numbers. The app isn't limited to a weekly basis and could be used for longer or shorter time increments, as it is up to the user how much time they want to input into the app.

The wagePage app takes user input including your hourly wage, hours worked for that week, and any tips you recieved.
The app then adds in the IL state income tax into your hourly wage and combines the hours with tips (if any) and gives you the actual total you would have made that week.
